				I see trees of green, red roses too I see them bloom for me and you And I think to myself What a wonderful world I see skies of blue and clouds of white The bright blessed the dayAnd the dark sacred night. And I think to myself What a wonderful world The colors of the rainbowso pretty in the skyAre also on the faces
				of people going by I see friends shaking hands saying How do you do Theyre really saying I love you I hear babies crying I watch them grow Theyll learn much more than Ill ever known And I think to myself What a wonderful world Yes I think to myself What a wonderful world Oh yeah
